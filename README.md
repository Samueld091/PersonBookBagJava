# PersonBookBagJava
This programs simulates a person's bookbag through the use of an ArrayList. It creates a person and a bookbag object that are tied to each other. The program then creates multiple objects ("possessions") with varying qualities, including price, and adds them to the bookbag. FInally, the program then prints all the objects in the bag with their details, and prints the total price of the possessions of the owner.

This program was made for an assignment for a COP2210 class.
